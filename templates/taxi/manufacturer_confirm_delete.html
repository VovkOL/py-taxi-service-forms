      I'm so sorry! That's my bad, something wrong was driving me.
      I'm so f*cking regret of this huge mistake.
      I had better think twice before put on button <strong>Delete</strong>.
      Please, God, save my soul from this button in the future.
      I've changed my mind, I wouldn't delete anymore!
